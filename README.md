apilb
=====

#What the earth is this?
apilb stands for api load balancer, it's a simple api to create a load balancing services to your instaces with a few tricks up its sleeve.
My friend @bettiolo woke up and had the idea, I loved it and we're working on it!

#How is this possible?
It's based on HAproxy's implementation and it will allow people to balance requests to different cloud platforms/instaces for free (low usage ofc, then it gets paid because otherwise we'll go bankrupt)

#What is this repo then?
I'm working on the front apilb site right now, because the backend core is already been done and in a secret repo away from the eyes of the internet until we're sure it works as intended (it will be all OpenSourced)
I'll be also doing the interface for the administration. 

#I Want to contribute!
Open issue with your ideas/contributions you would like to implement and we'll contact you
